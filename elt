Ensure you are running **Node v20+**.

Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

There is a docker-compose file which start a MySQL database, backend and frontend projects. You'd first need to build a base Docker image by running
```
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 . --tag nx-cli-local
```
Note: Change `arm64` to `amd64` if you are not on MacOS (with Apple silicone).


You can then start all the projects up using `docker compose up -d`.

If you experience issues with Docker, try running `nx reset`.

If you are on a Mac and experiencing issues, then you might need to run `npm rebuild --arch=arm64 --platform=linux` as well before starting backend/frontend projects in Docker.

Worst case scenario, you can run the backend and the frontend outside of Docker. You might need to create `.env.local` files with environment variables which are currently configured in `docker-compose.yml`.

You can navigate to the webapp by going to http://localhost:4200 in your browser.
